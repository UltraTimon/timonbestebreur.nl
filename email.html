<h2>Send me an email!</h2>

<p> 
    You can send me an email on tbestebreur [at] protonmail [dot] com.
</p>

<h3>Why this weird email formatting?</h3>
<p>
    The reason I don't write out the email address fully is because then a bot could easily find it on the website and add it to some spam list. I'd like to get in touch with you, but not with bots :)
