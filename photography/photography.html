<h1>My snapshots of the beautiful world around me</h1>

<p>
    I'm not that much of a photographer. I don't have a profile picture of myself holding some over-the-top camera. I don't carry a camera with me all day (not counting the 3.5 MP camera on my Nokia 3310). I don't know anything about composition, aperture, exposure etcetera.<b>*</b> But, I am fascinated with the world around me, and find that there is lots of beauty to be found all around me. Thus, I try to document these things using a classic retro point-and-shoot camera (which takes suprisingly good pictures by the way) to share some of the aesthetically pleasing sights around me. I have one simple rule: No zooming allowed. Everything you see is photographed exactly as I saw it. Enjoy!

    Take a look at my series of photographs on <a href="./flowers/flowers.html">flowers</a>, the <a href="./photography/delft/delft.html">city centre of Delft</a> or the windmills at <a href="./kinderdijk/kinderdijk.html">kinderdijk</a>.

    <b>*</b>Fun fact: I wanted to give at least three examples, as that looks stylistically more satisfuyuing to me, yet I could only come up with two. I had to search DuckDuckGo for a third one :)  Luckily there are nice websites like <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/blog/common-photography-terms/">this one</a> that provide all the information you might need on photography. Thank you internet!
