<h1>My Micro-Farm</h1>

<p> Around March 2020, when the government in the Netherlands decided that we should stay inside to stop the spread of the corona-virus, I was quite lost. Lots of social activities could not take place, I had to follow university courses from home and my whole day lost its structure. I wanted something to hold onto and create something positive to work on instead of being depressed by all the horrible news around me.</p>

<p> At the time, I was thinking about starting a micro-farm on my balcony by purchasing buckets, garden soil and vegetable seeds, filling the buckets with soil and planting the seeds in the soil. I kept putting it off because I had plenty of other things to do, but once the quarantine struck I had loads of time.</p>

<p> <strong> I decided to plant a seed of hope in a time of despair. Thus, The Micro-Farm was born. </strong></p>

<p>I planted Carrots, Beets and Cabbage and some red flowers. Around the end of August I harvested, and I was surprised by the big amount of vegetables that came out of my buckets!</p>

<p>These plants helped me tremendously during the quarantine, since they gave me a reason to get out of bed every morning: The plants needed water. Also, it was exciting to watch the plants grow and to have something to look forward to, something that will continue regardless of any quarantine-like measures.</p>

<p>I just planted some Radish seeds and I'm intending on continuing this micro-food production facility. It gives a lot of satisfaction and connection to nature. I can only look at these plants and be thankful for how beautiful they have been created by God. He really knew what He was doing.</p>
