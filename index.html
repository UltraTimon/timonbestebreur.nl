                                Hi there, I'm Timon. You might be wondering where you ended up or what this website is all about. Well, most of the personal websites around are <em>the</em> most boring collections of html files around. To make everyone's life a bit more fun, I tried to spice up my '... and here you can find my resume... ' game a little by inserting some sarcasm. So, if you were wondering: Yes, the 'quick links' section contains lots of jokes. I do <em>not</em> think my plants are shitty. I love my plants!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                I have a very positive self-image, I have high levels of self-confidence and I'm very proud of my <a href="https://blog.timonbestebreur.nl">
                    blog</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3Nt9mJ7ZodPwv4V6KcPzlZ?si=9kfRex9CSpWclkbbHYu7wg">podcast</a>, <a href="./photography/photography.html">
                    photos</a>, <a href="./farm/farm.html">micro-garden</a>, <a href="./woodworking/woodworking.html">woodcarvings</a>,  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-477877288">
                        music</a>, <a href="./recipes/">recipes</a>, <a href="Resume_Timon_Bestebreur.pdf">resume</a> and collection of <a href="./articles/inspired.html">lessons</a>, since these cover a quite wide area of skill and expertise. The fun thing about it is that you can undoubtably find someone else that does any of these things better than me. But <em>all of them, together?</em> I've yet to find someone. Throw in the fact that I'm building a Freaking <a href="./articles/satellite.html">SATELLITE</a> this year and we've got a pretty epic combination of skills.
            </p>
            <p>



                I do all of these things in order to become broadly skilled instead of an expert in a narrow field. The goal is to become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">polymath</a> or <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_man">renaissance man</a>. So far I really like the variety and creativity that this path has unleashed in me. This website is partly a documentation of this pursuit.
            </p>

            <p>Feel free to click around. I tried to make each page interesting, so there's a lot to see. If you'll excuse me? A kind lady from across the street bought too many lemons and offered some to me. See you later!</p>
