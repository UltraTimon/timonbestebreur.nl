                Hi there, I'm Timon. I do multiple things in order to become broadly skilled instead of an expert in a narrow field. I try to become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">PolyMath</a> or <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_man">Renaissance Man</a>, and so far I really like the variety and creativity that this path has unleashed in me. This website is partly a documentation of this pursuit. Currently I am <a href="http://github.com/UltraTimon">writing code</a>,<a href="./woodworking/woodworking.html">carving wood</a>, writing on my <a href="https://blog.timonbestebreur.nl">blog</a>, talking on my podcast (which you can listen to on<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3Nt9mJ7ZodPwv4V6KcPzlZ?si=9kfRex9CSpWclkbbHYu7wg">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/nl/podcast/fietsgedachten/id1529133166">Apple Podcasts</a>), making <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-477877288">music</a>, tending to a <a href="./farm/farm.html">Micro-garden on my balcony</a> and taking series of photographs, like this series of <a href="./photography/flowers/flowers.html">flowers</a>. Want to get in touch?<a href="mailto:timon@timonbestebreur.nl">Send me an email!</a> To get an overview of my professional life you can <a href="Resume_Timon_Bestebreur.pdf">download my resume</a>. Yet I do hope to convice you that I am more than my Resume!</a>

            Next to the things listed above, I like reading books. A lot. My Kindle and I are very close. Through reading all of these books I've been inspired to live my life in a certain way. You can read about that <a href="./articles/inspired.html">here</a>.
            
            <p>I plan on making most of my income by working as a Embedded Software Engineer, which is why I currently study Computer Science and Engineering at Delft University of Technology. I expect to graduate around July 2023.</p>

                If you wonder why this website looks the way it does, <a href="./articles/purpose.html">let me explain.</a>
            </p>

            <p>Wonder what I look like? Here's a <a href="./pf.png">picture of me</a>.</p>

            <p>However beautiful and important the earlier mentioned things might be, all of it pales in comparison to the truly important questions in life, like: <a href="wednesday.html">Is it wednesday?</a></p>
