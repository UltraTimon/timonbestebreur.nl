<h1>The people that inspired me</h1>

<p>My parents raised me and my teachers taught me. But beyond that, there were some other people that wrote books or articles which inspired me, gave me a new perspective and taught me to look at things differently. This is a list of these people, and the things that they taught me. I will not go into detail about everything they learned me, but highlight the one most important thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com">Thomas Frank</a> showed me that there exist a lot of interesting non-fiction books in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwY3A92s-xg">this video</a>, which opened the way for the next few people to come into my life.</p>

<p><a href="https://calnewport.com">Cal Newport</a> showed me that not all studying is equal and some methods are more efficient than others in his book <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/straight-a-student/">How to become a Straight A Student</a>, he showed me that being able to focus on a cognitively demanding task without distractions is a worthwile pursuit in his book <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work</a> and that being good at what you do gives more satisfaction than following your passion (since you will enjoy to do what you are good at) in his book <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/">So good they can't ignore you</a>.</p>
