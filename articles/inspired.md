# The people that inspired me

My parents raised me and my teachers taught me. But beyond that, there were some other people that wrote books or articles which inspired me, gave me a new perspective and taught me to look at things differently. This is a list of these people, and the things that they taught me. I will not go into detail about everything they learned me, but highlight the lessons that had the most impact on my life.

**Thomas Frank** showed me that there exist a lot of interesting non-fiction books in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwY3A92s-xg), which opened the way for some of the next few people to come into my life.

**Cal Newport** showed me that not all studying is equal and some methods are more efficient than others in his book [How to become a Straight A Student](https://www.calnewport.com/books/straight-a-student/), he showed me that being able to focus on a cognitively demanding task without distractions is a worthwile pursuit in his book [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/), that being good at what you do gives more satisfaction than following your passion (since you will enjoy to do what you are good at) in his book [So good they can't ignore you](https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/) and that free time is best spent pursuing hobbies and connecting with friends, without technology to take our time and energy in his book [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/).

**Timothy Keller** showed me that building your identity on the way God sees you is a good idea in his book [The reason for God](https://timothykeller.com/books/the-reason-for-god), since earthly things which people base their identity on (being rich, having a good carreer) may fall away. God however, will be with us whatever happens. 

**Charles Duhigg** showed me that habits exist and we can alter them in such a way that we can make out default behaviour the right behaviour in his book [The Power of Habit](https://www.charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/).

**David Allen** taught me that a mind is for having ideas, not storing them, and that I should get these ideas out of my head into a system as quick as possible in his book [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/).

**Barry Schwarz** taught me that reducing the options makes it easier to choose and be happier afterwards, because you don't think about all the other options that you didn't pick but may have been a better option in his book [The Paradox of Choice](https://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/bschwar1/books.html).

**Clive Staples Lewis** showed me another way to look at heaven and hell in his book [The Great Divorce](https://www.cslewis.com/us/books/paperback/the-great-divorce/9780060652951/). Instead of heaven being the place where "good" christians go and hell being the place where bad people are punished for their wrong behaviour during their time on earth, Lewis depicts heaven as the place where people who _want_ to be with God go to, and hell is just a place where God is not. The choice of where you want to go is up to the people themselves.

**Dave Eggers** showed me that not every technological advancement is one we should embrace wholeheartedly without being aware of the full consequences in his book [The Circle](https://daveeggers.net/the-circle).

**George Raymond Richard Martin** showed me that I really love medieval war stories in his book series [A song of Ice and Fire](http://www.georgerrmartin.com/grrm_book/a-song-of-ice-and-fire-box-set-books-1-4/).

**George Orwell** showed me that a life without privacy is something to be avoided in his book [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four).

**Nicholas Carr** showed me that the internet can shorten one's capability to concentrate, rewiring the brain in such a way that it becomes addicted to bits of information in his book [The Shallows](http://www.nicholascarr.com/?page_id=16). This motivated me to ditch my smartphone and carry my laptop and a Nokia 3310 with me.

**Annie Grace** showed me that life without alcohol leads to more fun at parties, better conversations and major health improvements in her book [This Naked Mind](https://thisnakedmind.com/purchase-naked-mind-control-alcohol-book/). This motivated me to stop drinking alcohol.

**Jordan Ellenberg** showed me that impossible things never happen, but improbable things happen a lot in his book [How to not be Wrong](http://www.jordanellenberg.com/how-not-to-be-wrong/).

**Dale Carnegie** showed me that you can make more friends by being interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people to be interested in you in his book [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People).

**Ramit Sethi** showed me that saving money can become an automated habit by automatically sending away your intended savings to a savings account at the beginning of the month instead of going about and savind whatever money is left at the end of the month (spoiler alert: Not Much) in his book [I Will Teach you to be rich](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/book/).

**Jesse Mecham** showed me that I need a budget in his book [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/ynab-the-book/). A budget gives me the overview of where my money is, what it's doing and it helps me to break down bigger payments in smaller monthly ones by saving for it for multiple months.

**Ashlee Vance** showed me that Elon Musk is a visionary with plans that are so big that sometimes he puts his plans above the people he works with, which sometimes resulted in him treating the people around him in an unfriendly way in her biography of [Elon Musk](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062463272).

**Greg McKeown** taught me that we get the most result if our work if we focus it towards one direction, instead of trying to advance multiple small projects at once in his book [Essentialism](https://gregmckeown.com/book/).

**Jason Schreier** showed me that the development of video games is a bumpy road, but one which can be very rewarding in his book [Blood, Sweat and Pixels](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062651235/blood-sweat-and-pixels/).

**Stephen Richards Covey** taught me to focus on my energy on the things I have influence on rather than worry about the things I don't have influence on in his book [7 habits of highly effective people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People).

**Mr. Swaroop** taught me how to use the VIM editor in his book [A Byte of Vim](https://vim.swaroopch.com), which I now try to use as much as I can since it is way more efficient than using a traditional text editor.
