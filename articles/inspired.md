# The people that inspired me

My parents raised me and my teachers taught me. But beyond that, there were some other people that wrote books or articles which inspired me, gave me a new perspective and taught me to look at things differently. This is a list of these people, and the things that they taught me. I will not go into detail about everything they learned me, but highlight the lessons that had the most impact on my life.

**Thomas Frank** showed me that there exist a lot of interesting non-fiction books in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwY3A92s-xg), which opened the way for the next few people to come into my life.

**Cal Newport** showed me that not all studying is equal and some methods are more efficient than others in his book [How to become a Straight A Student](https://www.calnewport.com/books/straight-a-student/), he showed me that being able to focus on a cognitively demanding task without distractions is a worthwile pursuit in his book [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) and that being good at what you do gives more satisfaction than following your passion (since you will enjoy to do what you are good at) in his book [So good they can't ignore you](https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/).

**Timothy Keller** showed me that building your identity on the way God sees you is a good idea in his book [The reason for God](https://timothykeller.com/books/the-reason-for-god), since earthly things which people base their identity on (being rich, having a good carreer) may fall away. God however, will be with us whatever happens. 

**Charles Duhigg** showed me that habits exist and we can alter them in such a way that we can make out default behaviour the right behaviour in his book [The Power of Habit](https://www.charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/).
