  <h1>The dream come true</h1>

  <em>Written on September 9, 2020</em>

  <p>
      I am fascinated by spaceflight. I think exploring other planets is the most ambitious thing we've ever done. This is because there is <em>so much</em> that can go wrong.
  </p>

  <p>If you make a tiny error you have too little fuel, you are too heavy, you miss your target or you explode into tiny pieces. Every piece of equipment that we send into space needs to be thorougly tested on vibration, heat resistance, air pressure changes and so much more. Compared to that the testing procedures we apply to cars are next to nothing. We drive them into a wall a few times and call it a day.
  </p>

  <p>
    The machines that we send into space don't have to be pretty good, they have to be excellent. The testing procedures don't need to cover most cases, they need to cover <em>each and every case imaginable, and then some.</em> Consequently, to work on something that goes to space you do not have to be pretty good at what you do, you have to be outstanding, knowledgeable and capable of producing something that is the best of the best.
  </p>

  <p>
      To me, this sounds awesome. The people that you work with are very talented and very driven, the hardware you work with is top of the line and the pace at which you improve your skills is very high. I would love to work on something that goes into space.
  </p>

    I had it all mapped out; First, I would complete my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, then continue to a master's degree in Embedded Systems. I would do an internship during my master's in some fun company and get a job after graduation. Then, I would keep on advancing, making sure that every new job got me closer to working with things that have something to do with spaceflight. And one day I would count down from ten to zero, look up and know that some computing system flying way up there runs code that I wrote. That is my dream.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, that would happen a relatively long time from now. It would take at least two years to complete my master's and then some more years to gather the experience needed for this great endeavour. But it would be worth the wait, right? And dreams are something to work towards slowly and deliberately. My time would come.

      But one day I opened my mailbox and I could not believe my eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
      I study in Delft, the Netherlands. The University in Delft has lot of cool student programs called Dream Teams. These teams, consisting of about 30-60 students, work together to build some crazy machines, like exoskeleton, Hyperloop vehicles and self-driving racing cars. You can read more about that <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ddream/teams/">here</a>. The email I received was not from one of those teams, but it is very similar. To celebrate the 75th anniversary of the student association of the Aerospace Engineering study programme a group of aerospace students wanted to build a satellite.
  </p>

  <p>And they wanted me to join!</p>

  <p>A satellite of course needs software to run, and they did not have enough software engineers. They asked whether there were computer science students who wanted to join the team and work with them to write software for the satellite. I checked out their <a href="https://vsv-satellite.com/">website</a> and quickly decided.</p>

  <p>I signed up right then and there. Then, after some interviews I got the email I was hoping for: I was accepted! Thus, I will be writing software for a satellite that will launch somewhere in 2021! I still cannot totally comprehend it, but I do know that I am very happy.</p>

  <p>
    My dream has come true.
