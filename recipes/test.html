<h1 id="handy-recipes-for-all-kinds-of-stuff">Handy recipes for all kinds of stuff</h1>
<p>I like to learn how to make basic things myself. This has two benefits; I learn how things work, I have complete control over what goes into my products, I am less dependent on stores and I get the product for <em>ridiculously</em> low cost, sometimes even 1/100th of the regular store price.</p>
<p>This page provides an overview of the recipes I use. This is mainly for my own reference, but you are free to use them as well!</p>

<p>Below are the memory aids for me such that I donâ€™t forget anything. To learn how to do this, watch lots of videos and try it out. I got it right after about 5 failures, so keep trying!</p>
