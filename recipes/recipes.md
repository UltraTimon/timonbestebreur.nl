# Handy recipes for all kinds of stuff

I like to learn how to make basic things myself. This has two benefits; I learn how things work, I have complete control over what goes into my products, I am less dependent on stores and I get the product for _ridiculously_ low cost, sometimes even 1/100th of the regular store price.

This page provides an overview of the recipes I use. This is mainly for my own reference, but you are free to use them as well!

## Bread

### Ingredients

- 300 g whole grain flour
- 100 g general purpose flour
- seeds and grains to taste (like sesame, pumpkin seeds, oatmeal etc.)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 packet of 7g yeast
- 300 ml handwarm water (the hottest such that you can still hold your hand in it for extended periods of time)

### Directions

Below are the memory aids for me such that I don't forget anything. To learn how to do this, watch lots of videos and try it out. I got it right after about 5 failures, so keep trying!

- add everything except water in a mixing bowl
- mix
- add handwarm water
- mix, keep adding general purpose flour until its dry
- when dry, dump on floured table and knead for 10 min
- put in bowl, cover with damp cloth
- let rise at warm place for 1 hour
- knead for 10 mins
- put in baking tin, cover with damp cloth
- let rise at warm place for 1 hour
- bake at 200 C for 20 mins
- bake with extra heat for 10 mins for the crust
