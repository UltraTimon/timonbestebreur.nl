<p>I like to learn how to make basic things myself. This has two benefits; I learn how things work, I have complete control over what goes into my products, I am less dependent on stores and I get the product for <em>ridiculously</em> low cost, sometimes even 1/100th of the regular store price.</p>
<p>This page provides an overview of the recipes I use. This is mainly for my own reference, but you are free to use them as well! You do have to read up on how to do this, I only list the ingredients and some memory aids for myself here.</p>
