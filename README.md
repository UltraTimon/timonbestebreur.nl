# Personal website of Timon Bestebreur

**Hi there! If you got here, but intended to go to the actual website, please click this link: 
[https://timonbestebreur.nl]**

This is the code for my personal website. Here I tell a little about myself and you can find out how to contact me.
For some reason Google does not index my website, but this repository scores quite good, so you can still get to the website via the link above.

I try to keep this website as minimalistic as possible, focusing on interesting content instead of flashy graphics. It may look barebones, but behind every link there is something interesting to read or watch!

I am capable of building a more complicated website, yet I prefer it this way. I like a website when it gets to the point quickly, without throwing animations and popups in my face whenever it seems necessary. This website is more like an online storage for my articles (see the [https://blog.timonbestebreur.nl/](blog)), podcasts, music and pictures, so I, my friends, family and other people that might be interesting can check them out.

It's a lot of fun to say: Hey, I took some nice [https://timonbestebreur.nl/photography/photography.html](pictures) today, let me show them! And then go to your website to scroll through. One day I might add some more fancy stuff, but for now it's exactly how I like it.
